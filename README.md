# Superpowers Web

Make static websites in live collaboration with [Superpowers](http://superpowers-html5.com/).

The Superpowers Web system uses [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) for HTML and [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) for stylesheets.

## How to install

For now, you'll need to build it from source. See [Building Superpowers](http://docs.sparklinlabs.com/en/development/building-superpowers).

Once Superpowers v1.0 is released, installing a new system will be possible in a couple of clicks!
